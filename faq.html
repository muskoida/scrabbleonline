      <p style="margin:0 0 22px;color:#444;">
        Below are common questions about word scramble solvers, how results are generated,
        and how to use these tools responsibly.

    <section>
      <h2>Is a word scramble solver accurate?</h2>
      <p>
        A solver is only as accurate as its underlying dictionary. Most tools reliably find
        valid words that can be built from your letters, but no dictionary is truly “complete”.
        Some rare, regional, or newly coined words may not appear.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why do different solvers give different results?</h2>
      <p>
        Each solver uses its own word list and filtering rules. One may include British spellings,
        while another focuses on American English. This is why comparing results across tools
        can sometimes be useful.

      <h2>Why is a word I know missing?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The word may not be in the supported dictionary.</li>
        <li>The letters entered may be incomplete or missing a repeated character.</li>
        <li>The word could be a proper noun, slang term, or abbreviation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does using a solver count as cheating?</h2>
      <p>
        That depends on the game and its rules. Many players use solvers for practice,
        vocabulary building, or casual puzzles. In competitive or ranked modes,
        external tools are often restricted and should be avoided.

      <h2>Are my searches or letters stored?</h2>
      <p>
        Companion pages like this one do not store personal input. Always review the
        privacy policy of the main tool you are using to understand how data is handled.

    <section>
      <h2>What is the best way to use a word unscrambler?</h2>
      <p>
        Use it as a learning aid. Try to understand *why* a word is valid, notice letter patterns,
        and improve your own skills over time instead of relying on tools for every move.
