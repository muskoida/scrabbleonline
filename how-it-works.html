      <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px;">How the WordScramble.eu solver works</h1>
      <p style="margin:0 0 22px;color:#444;">
        This page explains the core idea behind a word unscrambler: how it turns a set of letters into valid word options,
        what affects the results, and how to use it responsibly for learning and puzzle support.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px;">1) You provide the letter pool</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
        The solver begins with the letters you enter. Each letter can only be used as many times as it appears
        in your input. For example, if your letters include two “A” characters, results may include words that use
        two A’s — but not three.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;color:#444;">
        Tip: enter letters exactly as you see them (including repeats). If the puzzle gives you a blank tile or wildcard,
        treat it as a special case only if the tool supports it.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px;">2) The solver checks words against a dictionary</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
        Most unscramblers work by comparing your letter pool to a word list (dictionary),
a process closely related to classic word concepts such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
anagrams
</a>.
 A candidate word is valid if
        its letters can be fully “built” from the letters you provided.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;color:#444;">
        Different word lists produce different outcomes. Some dictionaries include more modern words, accepted variants,
        or regional spellings — so two tools can return slightly different results for the same letters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px;">3) Results are grouped, not “one correct answer”</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
        In many games, multiple answers are technically valid. That’s why an unscrambler usually shows a list of options,
        often grouped by word length.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin:0;padding-left:18px;">
        <li>Short words are useful for tight board positions.</li>
        <li>Medium words balance flexibility and scoring.</li>
        <li>Long words can be great if the board allows them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px;">4) Why you might not see a word you expect</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 12px;color:#444;">
        Common reasons a word doesn’t appear:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin:0;padding-left:18px;">
        <li>The word isn’t included in the tool’s word list.</li>
        <li>The word needs a letter you didn’t enter (or you missed a repeated letter).</li>
        <li>The word is a proper noun, slang, or a niche term not supported by the dictionary.</li>
        <li>The language/variant you expect differs (US vs UK spelling, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px;">5) Best practices (so it stays “learning”, not cheating)</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
        Use unscramblers for practice, vocabulary building, and casual puzzles. If you’re playing a competitive mode,
        or a platform that forbids external tools, follow their rules.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;color:#444;">
        A simple ethical rule: if you wouldn’t feel comfortable using it in front of other players, save it for training mode.
